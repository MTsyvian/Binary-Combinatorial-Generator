This project implements a Python-based generator that sequentially produces valid binary files according to a fixed file format. It uses a lazy depth-first search approach with a single reusable memory buffer to explore a very large space of possible files without storing intermediate states or causing memory spikes. This project was created as part of an assignment that required generating all possible valid files matching the given binary format. Since the total number of such files is astronomically large and full enumeration is not feasible in practice, explicit limits were applied to the generation process. These limits ensure that the generator remains executable and memory-safe, preventing RAM exhaustion while still correctly demonstrating the intended enumeration logic and file format handling.
